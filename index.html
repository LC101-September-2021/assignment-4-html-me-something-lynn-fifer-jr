            <p id="starFoxPara">At the top of my personal list is my all time favorite video game, Star Fox 64! The Star Fox series is about a fighter squadron of anthropomorphic animals.
               The team members are: Fox McCloud, Peppy Hare, Slippy Toad, and Falco. Peppy has the most experience as he was also on the Star Fox team with Fox's father, James McCloud. Slippy is the runt of the group. 
               He's probably the least proficient pilot of the four, but he is the one that manages the ship, the fighters, and everything tech.
               Falco is the 'ace' pilot of the group. Snide and snarky, he always has a quip to throw in. Dogged by his checkered past, Falco redeemed himself on the Star Fox team.  
               In this particular game, the team is led by Fox McCloud, who works with his team to turn the tide of an intergalactic war waged by the villainous Andross against the Lylat system.
               The gameplay is an on-rails shooter that also switches to a 3D shooter in certain circumstances. The story was pretty straightforward, but the writing for the end scenes are some of the best I've witnessed.
               SPOILER ALERT: Fox, just as he was defeating Andross, the villain says "if I go down I'm taking you with me", and destroys his lair trying to take out Fox.
               Fox's father, long thought to be deceased, comes to his son's rescue and leads him out of the lair. James, after leading Fox, fades away leaving Fox to wonder what exactly happened.

            <h2 class="Oblivion">Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</h2>
            <img id="Oblivion_cover" src="N:\HTML_me_something\assignment-4-html-me-something-lynn-fifer-jr\images\Oblivion_cover.png" alt="">
            <p>Next on my list is The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion, the game that started my fascination with role-playing games.
               Up until playing Oblivion, my experience with RPGs was limited. I was more interested in sports games like the 2k series. That all changed with a friend loaning me Oblivion.
               What drew me to the game was the amount of freedom you had in not only shaping the story but how that also shaped your character. My first character build was an assassin and I joined a guild called the Dark 
               Brotherhood. This storyline was full of intrigue and crazy plot twists. During the course of the DB storyline, I was really taken in by the members and really felt like I was part of this guild.
               That is until I progressed towards the end. My mission was to eliminate my guild, given to me by the object of the DB cult. 
               It was a mission I struggled with because I was really immersed into this group. That one storyline allowed me to enjoy other RPGs such as Divinity: Original Sin 2 and Pillars of Eternity.
